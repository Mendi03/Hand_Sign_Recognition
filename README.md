# Hand Sign Recognition for American Sign Language Alphabet

## Overview

This project focuses on making a Hand sign translator for the American Sign Language to be eventually be deployed in the Google play store. 

The project was created to build my personal portfolio while also filling what seems to be a gap in the Google play store. I wanted a better understanding of machine learning, app development, and Programming languages like Python and Java. 

## Features

Live translation of hand signs using the American Sign Language Alphabet.
